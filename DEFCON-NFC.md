Just here for the NFC Pass? Sure! `UberGuidoZ DEFCON31` (Use NFC Tools mobile app)<br>
HEX NFC Pass: `D8 D4 EB 44` (Works with Flipper - thanks Equip!)

Most people will find this page after meeting me at DEF CON 31 and getting an NFC coin. Thanks for saying hi! =) Hopefully you were one of the winners of 0.005 BTC... but if not, at least you got a cool coin!

Enough with the chitchat, you're here for NFC info. First off, the NTAG215 coin you have is reuseable. There is a password to prevent someone from just wiping it without reading it, but I intentionally did not lock it so you can do what you would like. You'll need to use a compatible [NFC writer](https://www.amazon.com/nfc-writer/s?k=nfc+writer) or software to remove the password and write your own goodies. I ***adore*** NFC Tools on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-tools/id1252962749) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc) which is what I used to password the coin you have.

Caution: The Flipper can read it and will claim to be able to remove the password. You need to use the HEX version above, not the text version! It won't hurt it to read it and you can capture/emulate it regardless. So grab a copy before formatting it! But alas, our little buddy won't be able to handle everything the same as NFC Tools can, though it will still work just fine.

This NTAG215 coin has 540 bytes of space (492 bytes useable) and can support a variety of URI page content! ([Check out NFC Tools](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/57457139/259277851-d885b977-d793-4f01-a5f0-8c0f1cf003aa.png).) I encourage you to explore the options, see what works, and test the limits of what you can do be it with NFC Tools or the [Flipper itself](https://docs.flipper.net/nfc).
